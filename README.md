__What's this?__

This repo contains community-created data files to support the creation of army lists for Mantic's Deadzone sci-fi miniature tabletop game (2nd and 3rd edition).

BSData organisation created this project. It's GitHub repository of datafiles.
Maintained by community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe. If you want
to develop - cool! We need you! Take a look at [Getting Started wiki][]

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._
